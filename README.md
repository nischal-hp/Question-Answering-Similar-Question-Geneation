# Question-Answering-Similar-Question-Generation

This repo contains the Research paper report for the "Machine Learning" course. The topic of research was "Question Answering and Similar Question Generation". Question answering is a domain in the field of Information retrieval and natural language processing where a tool answers different questions posted in natural language. The
answer is based on the context available for the program. Question generation is a part of the same domain where the
context is used to generate questions for which the answers do not lie outside the context. 

In this project, we built a question answering tool based on
the Stanford Question Answer (SQuAD) dataset and also tried
to generate similar questions based on the question and the
available context for that particular question. The problem
we aim to address is automation of answering questions in different
domains and to also create knowledge base for potential
questions which may need answering in these domains.
